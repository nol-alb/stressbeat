# stressbeat

Stress Beat is an interface that plays upon the
user perception of micro-timing and groove in
tandem with their physiological state. Tempo is
set by the user tapping their finger to the beat
of the desired tempo. A musical groove begins
playing to the set tempo, and the userâ€™s real-time
changes in the heart rate adjusts micro-timing
of an individual component of a drum groove.
If the heartbeat is actively increasing, the given
component occurs behind the beat in relation to
the rest of the groove/tempo grid, and vice versa.
